A simple vulkan render built in c++ that will hopefully have raytracing, forward+ rendering and the ability to eventually render fairly intensive scenes.

TODO: 
* Compute shader capability
* rewrite everything from main into components
* modulize buffers / figure out shared memory for vertex and indices
* add a frame rate checker
* optimize mesh input
* maybe cpu multi threading
* use vulkan 1.2-1.3 features for a raytrace 'enhanced' graphics pipeline initialization
